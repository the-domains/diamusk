**Bosnian born singer/songwriter Adisa Zvekić has been a 
performing artist since the 1990s. Her unique and powerful vocal talents
have been vital contributions to the musical projects of bands like _Gluho Doba against Def Age -- GDADA (BIH)_, _Dubioza Kolektiv (BIH)_ and _La Cherga (AUT)_. From her home in Bergen, Norway, she has launched her own solo project under the artist name _Diamusk_.**

Being co-founder of Zenica based _Gluho Doba against Def Age -- GDADA_
during Balkan war time allowed Adisa to distract herself from a 
situation of war darkness, hunger and hopelessness. Just as important, 
it proved a way to raise her voice and stand up for the values which 
every war threatens to destroy in a society.

Frustrated over government corruption and social regress in post war Bosnia, Adisa along with some of the _GDADA_ members teamed up with members of the Sarajevo based band _Ornamenti_ and started _Dubioza Kolektiv_ in 2003\. On Adisa's part, this resulted in participation on 4 releases; _Dubioza Kolektiv_ (album 2004), _Open Wide_ (EP 2004), _Dubnamite_ (album 2006) and _Firma Ilegal_ (album 2008), as well as  performing hundreds of concerts all over Europe.

In 2008, Adisa left _Dubioza Kolektiv_ and joined the band _La Cherga_,
based in Graz, Austria with other members originating from Croatia, 
Macedonia and Jamaica. In 2011, the band released the critically 
acclaimed album _Revolve_ with Adisa as lead vocalist. Together with _La Cherga_, she toured and performed live in numerous festivals and venues.

Moving to Norway in 2013, Adisa settled down to start a family and to begin the work with her solo project _Diamusk_. Her debut album _Wadada_,
due for release in April 2016, marks the beginning of a phase in 
Adisa's career where she is standing fully on her own two feet. All of 
lyrics, vocals, compositions, arrangements and production is done and 
performed by Diamusk herself, with able assistance from her husband.

With experience from several releases, more than 500 concert 
performances all over Europe and over 20 years of music experience, 
Adisa Zvekić is already an established artist of international format. 
The layers and deepness of lyrics to which no one can be indifferent 
combined with vocal powerfullness and musical talent, are key factors to
Diamusk making a musical impact world wide.
